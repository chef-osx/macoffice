Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac Cookbook
======================================

Installs Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac (corporate edition) and all updates
to December 2013.

Requirements
------------

#### Platforms

* `mac_os_x`

#### Cookbooks

* `dmg`

Attributes
----------

None

Usage
-----

Since the ISO is not available over the Internet, I've obfuscated the public URL in an encrypted data bag item. This should probably get refactored so that users can choose this method, or supply a URL using a node attribute.

The updates are all available over the Internet.
